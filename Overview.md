Week 3 Assignment from the Summer Analytics, 2024.
The assignment consisited of training a model on exisiting training data and passing prediction for the test data.
The Data was firstly, processed in an orderly and sophisticated fashion, 
by removing or replacing Nan Values, removing irrelvant data columns, converting categorical data into numerical and then standardising all the converted data into a simpler number base.
This was then followed by dividing the train data into train and test split for validation and parameter tunings.
The model choosen for the task was a Support Vector Machine (SVM) or Support Vector Classifier (SVC).
The predict were converted into probabilties and then converted into an .csv file for submission.
